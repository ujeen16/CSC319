# Mobile-App-Spotify-Assist
What is it

The idea behind the app is simple.  I like to listen to my favorite artists on Spotify
but am very busy and sometimes don't notice a new upload for some time.  This app allows a user to create an account and login.  Once logged in a user may update
a list which scrolls down the screen of the artist which they want to keep up to date with.  Whenever a new song comes out on the spotify api it is automatically 
added to an album in the users account.


How it works

This app is designed using flutter, dart, firebase firestore, and python.  Flutter, Dart, and Firebase are utilized for the account creation and frontend appearance.  Python is utilized for the script which updates the user song preferences.
